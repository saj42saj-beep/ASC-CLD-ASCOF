This repo is aimed at LAs who already produce and submit CLD data.
It is a branch of https://github.com/DataS-DHSC/ASC-CLD-LA-Dashboard more focused toward LAs.

SQL files have been numbered to better show the sequence of events as there are dependencies.
As at 7th October no changes have been made to core files in
* Stored_procedures
* Main_tables
* ASCOF_measures



It contains necessary TSQL to generate ASCOF measure figures so LAs can validate and know their results prior to submission.
