PREREQUESITES to setup code in your environment.

The code below is from https://github.com/DataS-DHSC/ASC-CLD-LA-Dashboard
It works well but needs some tweaking to run it locally.
1. replace schemas appropriate to your local database.
    **ASC_Sandbox.**
    **DHSC_ASC.**

2. You should already have looked at "Prepare local CLD dataset" to make sure you have **CLD_R1_Raw** which is the input data for a given period and validate correct values exist in your dataset.
